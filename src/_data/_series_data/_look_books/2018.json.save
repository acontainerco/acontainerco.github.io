      "description": "Because you may never come to DeLand, we bring DeLand to you. This is a place as circular as this View Master reel. Everything spreads all the time, inside and out. The woman who passes by your house every day at noon might actually be a ghost. The ghost in the cemetery may be still alive. Bright colors, many greens, the world is not as it seems.</p><p>Madison Creech works with fiber arts and Teresa Carmody works with sentences. For this project, we conferred about the ever-present death and growth of Central Florida, before walking our separate ways around DeLand to make seven images (Creech) and seven sentences (Carmody). Later, we paired the images with the text, almost exactly in the order that we presented them to each other.</p><p>DeLand. Something somewhere is not quite right, but that’s all right.</p>",
