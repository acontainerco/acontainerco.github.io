description: "This object was original a learning toy for children, and it still is even after we’ve transformed it.Rather than teaching children how to interact with a robot to deposit and withdraw money, this object now teaches both children and adults how not be become objects themselves. We’ve broken the voice box, and the ATM is filled with shredded money made of lines of anti-capitalism poetry that can be organized and re-organized into many different poems. It uses a learner-centered pedagogy to demonstrate the human need to make meaning for themselves and that creation is only possible if all the money is shredded. In the age of automated capitalism, the greatest human need is to be more human."
