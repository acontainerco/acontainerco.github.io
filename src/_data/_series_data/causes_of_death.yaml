description: "Seven curious and fantastical causes of death surface in a field of bright shards—like peering through a kaleidoscope into a world where, at any moment, one might die of wonder. _Causes of Death_ is an erasure of Guy Trebay’s “Dreaming of Bill Cunningham at the Men’s Wear Shows in Paris,” which appeared in the New York Times on June 28, 2016."
