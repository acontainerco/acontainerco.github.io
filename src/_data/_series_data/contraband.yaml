description: "Using several source texts _you are now carrying contraband_ is a sonic and visual exploration which places David Walker’s _Appeal_ alongside Amiri Baraka’s _Somebody Blew Up America_.  Walker would be murdered soon after the release of his _Appeal_.  Baraka, who served as the New Jersey Poet Laureate, would be asked to resign from his post after writing _Somebody Blew Up America_ following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.  After refusing to do so the governor took the case to the United States Supreme Court, removing the position from the state.  In situating these two texts and responses to them you are now carrying contraband examines censorship, surveillance, state sanctioned violence, and the appropriations and subversive uses black subjects have had of language—a technology often deployed against them."
