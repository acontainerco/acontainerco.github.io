description: "My work as an artist is rooted in ideas of home and how I orient myself in terms of all the places I've lived. With RISK, I was thinking about the rules of the game and the ways that land is defined and occupied. I knew almost immediately that I wanted to replace the army pieces with seeds that conjured up a sense of my childhood in Nebraska.\n
\n
With that in mind, I started gathering imagery for an accordion book that would replace the deck of cards and would incorporate elements of both the natural world and the nostalgia of childhood. I felt intimidated by the board itself until I started thinking about pop-up books and knew I wanted to turn the board into a three-dimensional garden. Using images cut from used gardening books, I pieced together flowers, bushes, and trees in shapes and colors that mimic the countries outlined on the board.\n
\n
In naming the book, I wanted a word that I could use to visually replicate \"RISK.\" Using two of the same letters, DIRT did the trick, plus it helps to keep the piece as a whole firmly planted in the earth."
