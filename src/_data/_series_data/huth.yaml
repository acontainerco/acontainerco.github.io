description: \"Illuminated Words\" is an extended piece of visual poetry as well as a narrative about a knight who has killed his own king and, haunted by his life, traverses the Earth while trying and failing to forgive himself. The glyphs in the pieces illustrate the story via calligraphic text displaying meaning absent the intercession of words. These glyphs are bolstered by titles describing the knight\'s thoughts and actions.
