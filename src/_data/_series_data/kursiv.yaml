description: "Kursiv #1-7 exhaustively uses every letter from a single sheet of dry-transfer lettering to create a suite of fragile typographic snowflakes. Each image, suspended within glassine film as part of a View Master slide, suggests a logo for an impossible business – or an alien script – caught between one dead media and another."
