description: 'These images are details from a photomontage series called "Occult Noir," which riffs upon, and, I hope, troubles various film noir conventions.  My collage and photomontage works are made up mostly of images I recall from movies, television, public service films, film strips, and print advertising from my childhood. I appropriate media from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s in particular, and source it from such places as the Good Will, antique stores, and the Internet Archive. The process is low-tech. Photographs are cut and pasted, marked on, painted on, re-photographed, manipulated digitally, cut and pasted, marked on, painted on, re-photographed until I have something that surprises me and I hope will be of interest to a viewer.


**Production Note**: "Occult Noir" is a _double reel_; subscribers will receive _2_ reels containing the entirety of the work.'
