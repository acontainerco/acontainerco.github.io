description: "As soon as the lunchbox arrived I understood it was to be a portable crystal grid. I have a very large grid made of crystals collected as gifts, etc., from over thirty years and this grid has been a healing device for myself and friends. The lunchbox is the perfect size for a compact grid. The amethyst enhances your creative capacities. The rose quartz opens the heart chakra. The carnelian is an empowerment stone, motivating us to span the distance between where we are and what we want to achieve.\n
\n
The base of the grid is planed oak that I coated in an ochre stain to give a solid, grounding place for the crystals, as well as to help contain their energies. The crystals were mounted with a clear industrial adhesive with the amethyst, rose quartz and carnelian on the east and west edges of the grid, and small clear quartz chards directing their frequencies to the center clear quartz stone. That center stone then holds the transmissions of the other crystals. There are also pieces of amethyst, rose quartz and carnelian inside the thermos to infuse drinking water to compound the grid experience with having an internal charge as well as the external from the grid itself. The copper bracelet is a conducting device which helps direct the grid's energy into your body. The bracelet is kept around a small pillow (sock with pillow stuffing) which has a rectangular chunk of selenite crystal inside it. Selenite's job is to constantly clean the grid, keeping the energy source of the crystals clear and viable for use"
