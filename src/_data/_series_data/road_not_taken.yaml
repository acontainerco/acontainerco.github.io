description: "_The Road Not Taken_ refers, of course, to the poem by Robert Frost, and my submission responds to the path of the poet — “the one less travelled.” Poetry is, in fact, the name of a town in Texas (and no other community in the world bears such a moniker). Maston Ussery, a merchant from 1865, has bestowed this name upon the town, because, for him, the region in springtime calls to mind a poem. I have marked this locale on Google Maps, capturing this site for a slide that precedes six other images, each of which represents a section from Poetry Rd. — a causeway, situated near Poetry, Texas. I have divided up the road into six equidistant coordinates, framing six straight, unmarked sections of the road on Google Maps, after which I erase any text, so as to produce an abstract painting — a kind of visual poetry that documents a path along which a poet might make a figural journey. I have included coordinates so that, after viewing the painting in the viewfinder, a reader might consult Google Maps in order to see this “road” of poetry in real life."
