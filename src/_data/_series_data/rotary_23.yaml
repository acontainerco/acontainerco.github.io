description: ""I was inspired first by View-Masters - those wheel-y viewers depicting scenes from movies in seeming three dimensions. It seemed to me that cutout poems, spread out across multiple frames, might make for an interesting layered effect, adding physical depth and providing multiple ways to read the poem. I wanted to work in the constraints of a Rolodex - the sleeves are traditional Rolodex sleeves, and cards are manipulated by a person. Each cut and mark is by hand, and there are still artifacts from how the work is put together in the frames. I also liked the fact that a Rolodex comes in an order, but cards are sometimes replaced mistakenly, which made me wonder what new meaning might emerge if the reader re-arranged the cards. The idea of a reader's ability to alter the text was very appealing to me."
