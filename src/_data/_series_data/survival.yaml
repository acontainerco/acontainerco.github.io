description: "_I’ve Been Thinking About Survival_ layers Mollie Oblinger’s renderings of the Great Lakes watershed & her drawings of creatures, with C. Kubasta’s words. Both artist & poet were inspired by the doings of their science colleagues & students, when they found themselves inhabiting the space of another discipline – watching others peer into microscopes, graph daphnia responses to environment, differentiate behaviors & bodies in experimental conditions."
