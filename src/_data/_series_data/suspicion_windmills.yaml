description: "To create On Suspicion that Windmills are Books, a book-object in the form of a Rolodex, I used a Trodat Professional 5253 Heavy Duty Self-Inking Do-It-Yourself Custom Stamp to make unique impressions on the Rolodex cards. The Trodat stamp set came with three and four millimeter rubber type that—with the help of a pair of plastic tweezers—could be set into the stamp’s text plate, which measures about two inches wide and one inch tall. With each stamped impression, I could print a brief poetic fragment—up to five or six lines with about two or three words per line. It seemed the perfect writing implement for the miniature landscape of the 4 x 2 ¼ in. Rolodex cards. At the same time, it seemed the worst implement possible: a self-inking stamp, the Trodat 5253 is, of course, best suited to imprint many copies of the same text. For example, one of the sample texts displayed on the stamp’s box reads as follows:\n

FAX 1-986-555-5372\n
OPEN 24 HOURS\n
\n
Setting the type piece by rubber piece, from right to left, was painstaking enough but to remove the type and return it to its 4 x 1 ½ in. plastic tray only to start the process again was a truly perverse exercise, a deliberate use of a technology against the grain.\n
\n
Then again, I wanted to combine composing, designing, typesetting, and printing into one single ensemble of activities, a glacially slow process that could allow for a maximum amount of meditative deliberation. Like illuminating a medieval manuscript. Like trimming a bonsai tree. In other words, if I was going to print a text, I would need to be fully committed to it given the amount of time and labor required to typeset it. I wanted a poetics of care antithetical to President Trump’s ill-advised “cofveve.”\n
\n
I got the idea to use the Trodat stamp from the Chilean fiction writer Matías Celedón, whose novella La filial (Alquimia Ediciones, 2012) takes the form of a stamped ledger (Melville House released an English version in 2016). Whenever I encounter a rigorous technique—in any medium—I often think, “How could that be applied to poetry?”"
