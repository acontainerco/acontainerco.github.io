description: "There appears today a consensus that the USA has entered an era of apocalyptic decline, that “The Fall” is finally upon us.\n
\n
I am suspicious of this thinking.\n
\n
From the moment a European stepped onto this continent, from the moment one “American” enslaved another, we have remained falling. Rather than a new creation, our current president is a very old one. Rather than speak his name, I call our president “Manifest Destiny.” Our destiny is perpetual fall.\n
\n
There is no single “Last Judgement.” There are no end days. There is only today. Today is everyday. So, today we get to work."
