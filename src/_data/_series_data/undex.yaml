description: "For the longest while I thought I would be doing something around the idea of an Index. I am a lawyer by training, and many years ago I prepared indices for a legal publishing house, so the idea of the Rolodex brought back the process of systems that aid the reader or searcher in finding information, which is what the index does. I was intrigued by the idea of the tension between the circle and the straight line, which when bent becomes the circle. The Rolodex is in fact a wheel which you turn, but the alphabet is sequential and is akin to a straight line with letters laid out one next to the other.\n
\n
I researched codes because again the idea of a system that allows you to enter an area that is closed to you seemed relevant. I was also intrigued by the idea of the Index put out by the Vatican which was in fact a sort of reverse index, in that it contained a list of books that \"good\" Catholics were prohibited from reading. The Index was, in fact, a system that fundamentally subverted the common understanding of what an index is intended to do -- give you access to further information.\n
\n
The Rolodex sat on my kitchen table for the duration of time I was thinking about what I would do with it. I then started taking out the cards and looking at them and one day decided I would burn the edges of some. The others sat on a shallow pan on top of a toaster oven while I did this. I then had the idea of baking them but thought to use brewed black tea to soak them in as they baked -- not wanting them to catch fire. The results were startling and beautiful. They also retained the smell of the tea. From that it was easy to move to using green tea, beet juice and coffee.\n
\n
I still had no idea how to realize my ideas about the Undex. Then one morning I awoke and the entire story about the Book of Un was there. I have for the longest while been interested in the power of the prefix un. Two letters that somehow are powerful enough to reverse certain acts or states, but that didn't work for others. The prefix un can be seen to be a kind of spell. Perhaps, also, the idea of the Index of the Catholic church that was really an Undex as it tried to undo the existence of certain books and writings was also at work. The culmination was The Book of Un with Undex, the latter being those words that defy being \"unned.\""
