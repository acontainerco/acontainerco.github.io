<p>Container is a project dedicated to publishing language in novel forms.
Often projects take the shape of things that are not what is normally
classified as "book-like." Rarely, our objects look like traditional books.
It depends.</p>

<p>Container's original run was from 2017 - 2019 under direction of 
Douglas Luman and Jenni B. Baker. This period of the press took a
long rest after Jenni's passing in late 2020 due to complications
from glioblastoma, a rare form of brain cancer.</p>

<p>In 2023, Container woke up.</p>
