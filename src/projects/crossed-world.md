## Artist's Statement

For the past several years I have been collecting / mistranslating signage from antiquities museums then reinstalling it elsewhere. These phrases, translated through Container’s signature style into cross-stitched pillow kits, now read suggestively in our domestic scenes, I think. To pair fragments displaced from mysterious thousands-years-old objects onto the everyday textiles we lay our heads on implies we gather centuries of broken, forgetful thought in our rooms. And that we can still name/misname our dreams as arriving from an ancient, unknown world to both comfort and disturb our bodies.

Cross-stitch kits were the inexpensive gifts / time-users grandmothers once thrust into children’s hands as a way to keep them still. The act of cross-stitching is easy, then, but also profound–x marks each spot. I like to picture the phrases randomly and multiply thrown onto furniture and beds. To me they combine Container’s signature witty elegance with the tug of something dream/dark.
