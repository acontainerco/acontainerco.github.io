summary: The Look Books subscription series places old experiences in a new context, presenting five hybrid literary and visual texts that can be read by inserting them into the viewer and advancing the frame forward.
production_details:  Over the course of the year, subscribers will receive one viewer and five (5) reels, mailed out bimonthly. Look Book reels fit most newer and vintage View-Master™ viewer platforms; the "Reels Only" subscription _does not include a viewer_, and is intended for those who were either previous series subscribers or individuals who have compatible devices.
